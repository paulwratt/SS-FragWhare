# SSFW TODO list

markdown style (so its pretty)

 - create more standalone Gerka's

## data views

 - add "dont count" to IPv4 data views (PHP)
 - add custom "index" (PHP) for certain folders (instead of using "fancyindex" (Nginx), paired with standard CSS per webserver default)
 - add other non-PHP languages (not needed ATM)
 - (maybe) add "raw" + "json" output to the data viewer (not sure how helpful this is ATM)

## SH scripts

 - seperate webserver url compilation from URL detection processing (makes it simpler to adapt new webservers, and more flexible for when to run URL updates)
 - (later) add other webserver specific scripts
 - something else (there is probably lots)
